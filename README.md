# Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to the repository for all my data engineering projects. This collection includes various projects related to data ingestion, processing, and analysis, using tools like Apache Airflow, AWS, and more.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains a series of data engineering projects that aim to demonstrate skills in data pipelines, automation, cloud technologies, and big data processing. The goal of these projects is to develop scalable and efficient data workflows, and they often involve working with real-world datasets or APIs.

### Technologies Used:
- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating and automating workflows.
- **AWS**: Leveraging AWS services such as S3, Lambda, EC2, and RDS for cloud-based solutions.
- **Python**: For scripting and data processing tasks.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing structured data.
- **Docker**: For containerizing and deploying projects.
- **Apache Kafka**: For streaming data.
- **ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load processes for data processing.

## Projects List

1. **Movie Data API Ingestion with Apache Airflow**
   - **Description**: A pipeline that ingests movie data from a public API and stores it in an AWS RDS database.
   - **Technologies**: Apache Airflow, Python, AWS RDS, REST API.
   - **Details**: This project demonstrates how to use Airflow to schedule data ingestion tasks, fetch movie data from an external API, and load it into a relational database for analysis.

2. **AWS Data Pipeline with Lambda and S3**
   - **Description**: A project that demonstrates how to automate data processing using AWS Lambda and store processed data in S3.
   - **Technologies**: AWS Lambda, S3, Python.
   - **Details**: This project involves creating an automated Lambda function to process incoming files and store the results in S3 buckets.

3. **Data Warehouse Design and Implementation**
   - **Description**: Design and implement a data warehouse using AWS Redshift.
   - **Technologies**: AWS Redshift, SQL, Python.
   - **Details**: This project demonstrates the design of a data warehouse architecture and how to load data into Redshift for analysis.
