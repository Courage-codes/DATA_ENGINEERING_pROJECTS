# Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to the repository for all my data engineering projects. This collection includes various projects related to data ingestion, processing, and analysis, using tools like Apache Airflow, AWS, and more.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains a series of data engineering projects that aim to demonstrate skills in data pipelines, automation, cloud technologies, and big data processing. The goal of these projects is to develop scalable and efficient data workflows, and they often involve working with real-world datasets or APIs.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For scripting and data processing tasks.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing structured data.

## Projects List

1. **Movie Data API Ingestion with Apache Airflow**
   - **Description**: A pipeline that ingests movie data from a public API and stores it in an AWS RDS database.
   - **Technologies**: Apache Airflow, Python, AWS RDS, REST API.
   - **Details**: This project demonstrates how to use Airflow to schedule data ingestion tasks, fetch movie data from an external API, and load it into a relational database for analysis.
