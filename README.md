# Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to the repository for all my data engineering projects. This collection includes various projects related to data ingestion, processing, and analysis, using tools like Apache Airflow, AWS, and more.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains a series of data engineering projects that aim to demonstrate skills in data pipelines, automation, cloud technologies, and big data processing. The goal of these projects is to develop scalable and efficient data workflows, and they often involve working with real-world datasets or APIs.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For scripting and data processing tasks.

## Projects List

1. **Movie Data API Ingestion with Apache Airflow**
  This project explores trends and performance metrics in the film industry using data extracted from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It involves data extraction, cleaning, and analysis of 19 well-known movies to uncover insights about revenue, budget, profitability, and popularity. The analysis compares franchise and standalone films, evaluates director and actor performance, and uses visualizations to highlight key findings. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can support strategic decisions in movie production and marketing.
