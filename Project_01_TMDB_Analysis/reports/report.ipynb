    "# Movie Data Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents an analysis of movie data extracted from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The analysis aims to understand trends in movie performance, identify factors influencing success, and compare the performance of franchise films against standalone films.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movie data was extracted using the TMDb API for a selected list of 19 movie IDs, including blockbusters like 'Avatar' (id: 19995) and 'Interstellar' (id: 157336).\n",
    "- Data retrieved included movie details (title, release date, genres, overview), financial information (budget, revenue), and cast and crew details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- The raw JSON data was transformed into a structured Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- Irrelevant columns like 'adult', 'imdb_id', and 'homepage' were dropped.\n",
    "- Nested JSON columns (genres, production_companies, etc.) were parsed to extract relevant information.\n",
    "- Data types were converted for analysis (e.g., budget and revenue to numeric, release_date to datetime).\n",
    "- Missing values were handled by replacing zeros in budget, revenue, and runtime with NaN, and replacing placeholders in overview and tagline with NaN.\n",
    "- The dataset was filtered to include only released movies and rows with at least 10 non-NaN values, ensuring data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- KPIs were defined, including:\n",
    "    - Revenue (in million USD)\n",
    "    - Budget (in million USD)\n",
    "    - Profit (Revenue - Budget)\n",
    "    - ROI (Return on Investment - Revenue / Budget)\n",
    "    - Vote Count\n",
    "    - Vote Average\n",
    "    - Popularity\n",
    "- Movies were ranked based on these KPIs to identify top performers, such as 'Avatar' having the highest revenue and 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' having the highest profit.\n",
    "- Advanced searches were conducted, such as identifying the best-rated Science Fiction Action movies starring Bruce Willis (e.g., 'Looper') and movies starring Uma Thurman and directed by Quentin Tarantino (e.g., 'Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1').\n",
    "- Franchise and standalone movie performance was compared based on mean and median values of key metrics, revealing that franchise movies tend to have higher popularity and ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib was used to create visualizations, including:\n",
    "    - Scatter plot of revenue vs. budget to visualize the relationship between these two variables.\n",
    "    - Bar chart showing the average ROI per genre, highlighting the profitability of different genres.\n",
    "    - Scatter plot of popularity vs. rating to explore the correlation between these metrics.\n",
    "    - Line graph illustrating yearly trends in box office performance.\n",
    "    - Bar chart comparing key performance metrics (revenue, ROI, budget, popularity) between franchise and standalone movies.\n",
